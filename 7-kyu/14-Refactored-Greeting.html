      /* The following code could use a bit of object-oriented artistry. 
      While it's a simple method and works just fine as it is, in a larger 
      system it's best to organize methods into classes/objects. (Or, at 
      least, something similar depending on your language)
      
      Refactor the following code so that it belongs to a Person class/object.
      Each Person instance will have a greet method. The Person instance should
      be instantiated with a name so that it no longer has to be passed into each
      greet method call.

      Here is how the final refactored code would be used: */

      // Solution 1: Class

      class Person {
        constructor(name) {
          this.name = name;
        }
        greet(name) {
          alert(`Hello ${name}, my name is ${this.name}`);
        }
      }

      // Solution 2: Fuction

      function Person2(name) {
        this.name = name;
      }

      Person2.prototype.greet2 = function (yourName) {
        return 'Hello ' + yourName + ', my name is ' + this.name;
      };

      // Solution 3: Function Expression

      let Person3 = function (name) {
        this.name = name;

        this.greet3 = function (whom) {
          return 'Hello ' + whom + ', my name is ' + this.name;
        };
      };

      var joe = new Person('Joe');
      joe.greet('Kate'); // should return 'Hello Kate, my name is Joe'
      alert(joe.name); // should == 'Joe'
    </script>
  </body>
